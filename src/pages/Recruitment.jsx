      <p> Thank you for your interest in CU Geodata! We recently began our recruitment process for the Spring 2025 semester! Below you can find a link to our team application, which includes a set of short questions to learn more about you. We also hold coffee chats if you want to learn more about us!

Please note that the General Project Team Application must be completed in addition to the CU GeoData Application. </p>
